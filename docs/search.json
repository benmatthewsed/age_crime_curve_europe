    "text": "Conclusions\n\nIf you believe in the invariance these about the age-crime curve, you almost lose by winning - I’d say that three of the four countries showed pretty ‘classic’ age-crime curves throughout the period analysed, but one didn’t\nThis is implies that there are between country differences in how the age-crime curve has changed over time\nBut the whole point of the invariance thesis is that it’s invariance across time and place - so the fact that the change in the age-crime curve in Scotland seems very different than in Denmark, Finland and Norway is (I would argue) a bad thing for the invariance thesis\nThis initial analysis raises lots of questions about… crime types, other demographics (gender, ethnicity, income… etc) that could be answered by more bespoke data\nHaving done this analysis for (some of) Northern Europe, I think maybe an even more maximalist approach would be better - and can extend this comparison to anywhere that publishes data on age and conviction"
